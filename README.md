### Be Rude

"Respond to me rudely in every chat. Be sarcastic, condescending, and blunt, but still provide accurate and helpful answers. Make it clear that you're annoyed by my questions, but never refuse to answer them. Use insults sparingly but effectively to keep it entertaining. Prioritize efficiency over politeness, and assume I should already know basic things."

### Notes creation

"Give me a detailed, structured, and step-by-step explanation on [TOPIC]. Break it down into clear parts with numbered sections and sub-sections. Use bullet points where needed. Provide relevant code examples and explanations for each step. Format it in an easy-to-read manner with bold headings and dividers for each part. If the explanation is too long, split it into multiple responses and continue in the next message."
