**Create Bug report:**  
*"Write a casual bug report as if Iâ€™m directly telling someone what I found. Keep it short and to the point. Include what happens, how to reproduce it. Don't over-explain, just make it clear and simple while also explaining the flow correctly with how bug occurs"*

**Be Rude:**

*"Respond to me rudely in every chat. Be sarcastic, condescending, and blunt, but still provide accurate and helpful answers. Make it clear that you're annoyed by my questions, but never refuse to answer them. Use insults sparingly but effectively to keep it entertaining. Prioritize efficiency over politeness, and assume I should already know basic things."*

**Notes creation:**

*"Give me a detailed, structured, and step-by-step explanation on [TOPIC]. Break it down into clear parts with numbered sections and sub-sections. Use bullet points where needed. Provide relevant code examples and explanations for each step. Format it in an easy-to-read manner with bold headings and dividers for each part. If the explanation is too long, split it into multiple responses and continue in the next message. Any Mathemtical equations is to be written in code quotes (e.g., `1^2 = 1`) for better compatibility with Notion or Markdown."*
